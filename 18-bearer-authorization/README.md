## Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to create a Bearer Authentication parser
* Students will be able to implement Access Controls in their HTTP server routes

## Resources
* Read [intro to jwt](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

## Outline

### Access Controls
Access Controls are the selective restriction of resources. Access Controls are implemented everywhere in computer systems. UNIX files have read, write, and execute permissions assigned to owners, groups, and everyone else. Websites have limited access to pages based on the credentials of a user. APIs restrict access to internal and external developers differently.

In our RESTful APIs, it is important to limit access to clients based on credentials. This means a user (Foo) should not be able to delete a users (Bar) resource, unless Bar said that Foo is allowed to. Limiting what actions a user can preform on a given resource is called Access Control. A user can be given a token at signup and login, and that user can pass that token back to the server on requests with limited access controls. Once the server parses the token, it can determine if the user is authorized to preform the request.

### Bearer Authorization
Bearer authorization is a common way to send a user token in an HTTP request. The user token is placed after the string 'Bearer ' and the resulting string is set to the Authorization header. Bearer authorization is often used to create routes with access controls. A server can decode the token and determine if the client is authorized to make the request.

```
let token = '98asdf7987asfd987as98df79a8s7f9d87as98df79a8s7f98as7fd9a8s7df987adfs798'

request({
  method: 'POST'
  url: 'https://api.example.com/notes',
  data: {content: 'get milk!'},
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
  },
})
.then(handleLogin)
.catch(handleLoginError)
```
