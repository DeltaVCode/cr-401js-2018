# Lab 35: Sorting Algorithms

## Implement Insertion Sort

## Specifications

- Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
- Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called `data-structures-and-algorithms`, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
- Create a branch in your repository called `insertion_sort`
- On your branch, create...
  - _C#_: a new console app named `InsertionSort`
  - _JavaScript_: a file called `insertion-sort.js`
  - _Python_: a file called `insertion_sort.py`
  - _Java_: a file called `InsertionSort.java`
- Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
  - _NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository._

## Features

- Define a function that accepts an array and returns a sorted array
- The function must use an insertion sort algorithm

## Resources

Review what an insertion sort is:

- [Why Tailors use Insertion sort](http://computationaltales.blogspot.com/2011/04/why-tailors-use-insertion-sort.html){:target="_blank"}
- [Insertion Sort Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort){:target="_blank"}
- [Sorting Visual](http://sorting.at/){:target="_blank"}
- [VisualAlgo Sorting](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting?slide=1){:target="_blank"}

1. Visit [VisuAlgo Sorting](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting)
2. Select "INSERTION SORT" (INS) located on the top navigation
3. Click Sort, then "Go" in the bottom left corner
4. Pay attention to the PsuedoCode located in the bottom right corner

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

## Submission Instructions

1. Create a pull request from your branch to your `master` branch
1. In your open pull request, leave as a comment [a checklist](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents){:target="_blank"} of the specifications and tasks above, with the actual steps that you completed checked off
1. Submitting your completed work to Canvas:
    1. Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the corresponding Canvas assignment
    1. Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box
    1. Add any additional comments you like about your process or any difficulties you may have had with the assignment
1. Merge your branch into `master`, and delete your branch (don't worry, the PR link will still work)
