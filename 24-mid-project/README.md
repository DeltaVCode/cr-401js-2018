===

## Outline

### Milestones
By the completion of Day 4, your team should be at MVP.  If you are not at *or* close to MVP by the time you meet for standup, you will be given an hour to come up with a plan, which will then be subsequently presented to the instructor for approval.  To meet MVP, your application should be fully functional and meet the following requirements:

- Your application is deployed and working without issue.
- Your application code coverage rate is 90% or higher *(target 95%)*.
- All of your tests pass, everytime you run them.
- Your application contains a robust `README.md`, that includes **all** necessary documentation for how to use your application.
- You've practiced presentations amongst your group and have sync'd with an instructor to ensure the presentation format is as expected.
