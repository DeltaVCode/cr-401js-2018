## To Submit this Assignment

* Do all your work in a public repository called `data-structures-and-algorithms`
* fork this repository
* write all of your code in a directory named `stacks-and-queues`
* push to your repository
* submit a pull request to this repository
* submit a link to your PR in canvas
* write a question and observation on canvas

## Requirements

### Configuration

<!-- list of files, configurations, tools, etc that are required -->
Your lab directory must include:

* **index.js** -- The entry point to your module
* **README.md** -- with a documentation about your lab
* **.gitignore** -- with a robust .gitignore
* **.eslintrc** -- with the class .eslintrc file
* **.eslintignore** -- with the class .eslintignore
* **.package.json** -- with all dependencies and dev-dependencies
* **lib/** -- directory for holding your programs helper modules
* **test/** -- directory for holding your programs unit and integration tests

### Testing

* write at least three test assertions for each method of the Stack and Queue List Data Structures
* organize your tests into appropriate describe/it blocks for test output readability

### Documentation

* in your README, write documentation for you data structures
* your documentation should includes code block useage examples
* provide instructions for:
  * installing and using your data structure
  * accessing each method
  * running your tests

### Feature Tasks

* implement a Stack constructor
* implement `push(value)` and `pop()` methods on the Stack class
* implement a Queue constructor
* implement `enqueue(value)` and `dequeue()` methods on the Queue class
