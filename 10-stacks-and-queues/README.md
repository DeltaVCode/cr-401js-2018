# Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to implement a stack
* Students will be able to identify use cases for a stack
* Students will be able to implement a queue
* Students will be able to identify use cases for a queue

## Resources
* Watch [stacks and queues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjI1WNcIntg)
* Read [stack wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))
* Skim [queue wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))

## Outline

### Stacks
Stacks are a data structure that serve as a collection of elements. These elements are stacked in a last in, first out sequence **(aka LIFO - last in first out)**. It may help to think about a stack as a collection of plates and the way that you add and remove them.

Stacks are often used for history capability with undo functionality and call stack management. Some common methods include `pop`, which removes the most recent element from the stack, and `push`, which adds a new element to the stack.

### Queues
Queues are also a data structure that serve as a collection of elements. Elements in a queue are added in a first in, first out sequence **(aka FIFO - first in first out)**. It may help to think about a queue as a bunch of people standing in line at a concert - the first person in line is the first person in the venue. Common methods include, `enqueue`, which is used to add an element to the end of a queue, and `dequeue`, which is used to retrieve and remove an element from the beginning of a queue.
