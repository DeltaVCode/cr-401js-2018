### Singly Linked List
There are no FILO/FIFO-style constraints on singly linked lists
  * **FILO** - first in last out
  * **FIFO** - first in first out

Singly linked lists contain a series of nodes where each node contains a value as well as a `next` property. This property points to the next node in a line of interconnected nodes. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include:
  * insertion (ie: `append` and `prepend` methods)
  * deletion (ie: `remove` method)
  * traversal (ie: `find` method)
