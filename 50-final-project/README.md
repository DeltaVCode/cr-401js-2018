===

## Outline

### Plan Your Presentation

* Shoot for a presentation of 10 minutes; under no circumstances should you exceed 15 minutes.
* It is better to leave your audience wanting more than to test the limits of their attention span.
* Expect to take a few minutes after your 10 minute presentation to answer audience questions.
* Start with each student giving an introduction: first and last names, background, and goals with studying code.  Having an "About us" section of your `README.md`, or as a part of your final application, is a good thing to have as a backdrop!
* Decide on who will say what during the presentation. It may be helpful to write up an outline of the presentation beforehand. 
* Who will give an intro to the project, and tell us about the problem domain and your team's solution?
* Who will talk about the functionality, and walk the audience through the API routes you've created?
* Who will talk about a technical obstacle (or two) that arose during project week and how your team overcame it?
* Each person should describe some of what they contributed to the project and how that fit into the whole. 
* Every team member needs to speak! Build at least a skeleton of a script and work from it in your rehearsals. 
* Think about how to trade off speaking roles, and practice making that transition fluidly.
* Generally, do not plan to show code unless asked.  Have sample code ready to showcase and discuss, if this ends up being the case.
* Who will show us the code, if you end up doing so?
* Be sure to share a link to your deployed version, and provide contact information for your team members (email addresses, GitHub profiles, LinkedIn profiles, Twitter handles, any other relevant links) on the final version of your `README.md` and/or as a part of your final deployed application.

### Rehearse Your Presentation

* One rehearsal is not enough (at least do it twice); ten is too many. Somewhere in there is the right number for your team.
* Instructors and/or TAs will coach you through the process: they've all done this before.
* Set a timer and take turns talking through your topics so you know how much time each segment will take.
* If your team finds it is going over 10 minutes, refactor or trim out some pieces.
* Practice with the microphone so that you are comfortable with it and know how far to hold it in front of your face. 
* Be careful of walking around with the microphone: if you step directly in front of the speakers there is a risk of feedback.
* Make sure to practice how you intend to present--speak clearly, don't keep your hands in your pockets, stand up straight, etc. 

### The Actual Presentation

* Showcase your product and your team as if you were trying to sell them, or gain investors.
* There is a possibility of video recordings of the presentations that will go on YouTube.
* No need to go formal, but dress reasonably nice (aka buisness casual).
* Show that you take the presentation process seriously: BE PROFESSIONAL.
* Think of your presentation as something you'd like a hiring manager to see.
* Itâ€™s very possible that a future boss will view this presentation, whether live or on video!
* Speak clearly, and speak a little more slowly than you would ordinarily.
* Avoid using slang or profanity.  Be a consummate professional!
* Don't give your presentation while holding a beer in your hand, chewing gum, etc.
