===

## Outline

### Milestones
By the completion of Day 2, your team should be meeting the requirements outlined below.  These requirements will be checked during standup the following day.

* All component scaffolds are completed.  This means that a `class` has been created for each component and general `props` and `state` have been identified and/or defined.
* Your application `redux` workflow should be configured and working properly.  This will require the inclusion of *at least* a single action creator file, related reducer file, and the proper hookup/setup with that of the `redux` store and `<Provider />`.
* Any backend routes that need to be created/modified are *at least* identified and, if time permits, completed.
