===

## Outline

### Milestones
By the completion of Day 4, your team should be at MVP.  If you are not at *or* close to MVP by the time you meet for standup, you will be given an hour to come up with a plan, which will then be subsequently presented to the instructor for approval.  To meet MVP, your application should be fully functional and meet the following requirements:

* Your frontend *and* backend applications are deployed and working as expected.
* All remaining `.scss` component styles have been completed and implemented.
* Your frontend application has been reviewed, manually tested, and approved by an instructor.
* Both your frontend and backend applications contain a robust `README.md`, that includes **all** necessary documentation for how to use the application (as a user and/or as a developer).
* You've practiced presentations amongst your group and have sync'd with an instructor to ensure the presentation format is as expected.
